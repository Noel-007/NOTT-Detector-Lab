A comprehensive repository for the characterization and optimization of the H2RG infrared detector, developed as part of a thesis project. This repository includes code for analyzing detector performance under various configurations, identifying bad pixels, evaluating spatial and temporal noise, optimizing spectral resolution windows, and generating meaningful visualizations. The project contributes to the Asgard/NOTT instrument development, focusing on L-band nulling interferometry for exoplanet detection.
